### The Clean Résumé Template

> Note: This template uses [Fira Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) for headings and [Charter](practicaltypography.com/charter.html) for body text. Both are available for free download. It's unlikely that you have either of them installed on your system, so you will need to download and install with Font Book if you're using a Mac. Windows users should right click on the font file and select 'install'. You can, of course, use different fonts if you prefer.

Most of us never really take the time to learn the ins and outs of our word processor of choice (usually Microsoft Word). We get by just fine, churning out documents, memos, and the like with unsophisticated typography and typesetting. I would like to believe that we would all prefer to be churning out documents that are sexy as hell, it's just that we are rarely presented with sufficient motivation to learn the skills required. Or just as likely, we're blissfully ignorant that our typography is lacking in the first place.

The one exception is our résumé. Now that's one document where we start to sit up and pay attention. _We're invested_. The only issue is that when it comes time to create or update our résumé, we're so pressed for time that learning a few typesetting fundamentals, not to mention the word processing skills it takes to implement them, fall by the wayside and it comes out looking as drab as the last report you threw together.

It was a revelation when I stumbled upon [_Practical Typography_](http://practicaltypography.com/) by Matthew Butterick. After reading from cover to cover (and [donating](http://practicaltypography.com/how-to-pay-for-this-book.html)!), I felt empowered with typographic knowledge and got to work applying the advice within to my own resume.

I soon realized that I had a very polished and professional looking template on my hands and it would likely be useful to others (especially developers and programmers whose design skills largely exist in their own imagination). Thus, the Clean Resume Template was born.

If you find this template helpful, you may be interested in reading [_Practical Typography_](http://practicaltypography.com/) so you can apply typographic fundamentals in other areas of your career. Seriously, your boss and coworkers will thank you (and [Pat Bateman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY&t=1s) will be jealous). Online books like this are supported through your generous donations, so if you find it helpful [please donate](http://practicaltypography.com/how-to-pay-for-this-book.html)!
